# Message-Encoder-DecodeR
This project is based on encryption algorithm and it will give you a lot of knowledge about basics of algorithms.
I have created a message encode- decode system where the user inputs the message and according to vigenere cipher algorithm it 
provides a hashed(scrambled) string which can be copied.
Using the decoder mode we can decode this hashed value and the message would be in front of you. You can easily understand the coding with the comments written around the code !
